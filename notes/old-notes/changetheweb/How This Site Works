This is a \l https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding live coding \l
experiment, you will be able to see this site change in real time as we type out new code.
Sections will change, but the entire history of the project is saved in meta.json.
You can find the past versions by taking any digest from meta.json and appending it to the url 
"https://changetheweb.xyz/info/". If you would like to see the repository, it is available
\l https://github.com/dragosrotaru/changetheweb on github \l. If you have any suggestions at all please let us know on Github.
The latest code will not be in github because as explained, the version control is custom built using content-addressing.

The files for the current version of this project are:

-

\l index.html \l
\l meta.json \l
\l style.css \l
\l client.js client.js - code running on this webpage \l
\l server.js server.js - code running on the server \l
\l watcher.js watcher.js - code running on my PC \l

If you have any suggestions for the content of the site itself, please let
us know in person if you know us personally, and on Github if you don't.
Soon you will be able to join the conversation in the new web of meaning.
