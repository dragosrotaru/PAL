/* 
HTML provides various types of Elements for text:

- <p> - paragraph
- <h1> to <h6> - headings
- <a> - anchor
- <br> - line break
- <hr> - horizontal rule
- <q> - quote
- <abbr> - abbreviation
- <address> - address
- <em> - emphasis
- <strong> - strong
...

The API for these very poor. The semantics of HTML often
doesn't match the formatting of the text. The semantics
are generally important for accessibility, but it seems like
a poor way to implement accessibility when we have AI. 

One of the most important aspects is to include multi-language support from the 
start.
