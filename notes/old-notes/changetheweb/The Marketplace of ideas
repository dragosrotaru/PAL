Are we heading toward a reified marketplace of ideas? Should the
hypergraph be attached to a mechanism of financial transaction, or left
free? Content is created by Agents. Agents can be paid for their content
through donations. If the creator wishes to keep his content paid only,
should he have a right to do so? Certainly, I would say. Should the system
specifically enable this behaviour? Maybe, for user adoption. If some
company wants to implement DRM, they should be able to. I dont think it
should be endorsed. What about Copyright?
