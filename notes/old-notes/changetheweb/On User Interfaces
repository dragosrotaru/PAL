On the WWW, the website controls the presentation of its information with
its own User Interface. This needs to be neutralized. The control over
User Interfaces should be a spectrum of infinite possibility. You should
be able to design your own interface to any content on the web, to enable
people with different needs to have access. Animals should have access to
the Web. Dogs like watching dog videos! Imagine a world where we can
listen to chicken-generated music. Chicken Composers. Bok Bok or Bach?
Standardized UI means lower cognitive overhead, no shitty UI, no doubling
of work (1000's of web frameworks, billions of web page designs).
Translation, Simplification, Sensory Impairments.
