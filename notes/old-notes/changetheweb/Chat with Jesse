Responsability in Journalism vs Story Telling - Jesse watched the
Jeffrey Epstein Documentary. We discussed the difference between
Story-telling and Journalism. We discussed the relationship between The
narrarator, the narrative and the reader. We discussed the
responsability of the narrarator towards the reader in the crafting of a
narrative. What is the difference between a story and an account of
Reality? Are not all accounts of reality simply stories we tell
ourselves based on our perceptions?

Content vs comment dichonomy. The new web should have no hierarchy of
content vs comment. All comments are content. "Comments" should be able
to connect to not just a parent comment (like Reddit, Facebook, Youtube,
Twitter), but to multiple pieces of content. This is a HyperEdge.

Why do we have a like button but not an "I understand" button?

Recording conversations Live and publishing them. Lets Expand on the
Idea of a podcast and allow two people to have a conversation, add it to
the hypergraph anyone else can continue that conversation. Lets have an
endless sea of conversations. Lets transcribe the Conversations between
two people and add it as textual representations in the HyperGraph. Lets
have multiple translations of these Podcasts.
