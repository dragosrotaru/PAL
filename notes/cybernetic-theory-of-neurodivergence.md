These are all thoughts I had on ketamine, sorry they are super out there, I promise I am not insane I just experiment with drugs.

- how is internet molding our brains? How are we adapting and evolving to become cybernetic?
- nobody instructed me on what to pay attention to, I had very little supervision, I am one of the first internet baby generations.
- unsupervised children are educated by stochastic processes rather than distilled knowledge transfer from parents (of course as a spectrum)?
- more kids are autistic these days because parents have less time to supervise their children? Or because we are better at identifying autism? Probs both.
- are children more attuned to nom localized issues and less their immediate surroundings?
- is jesus christ as the son of god a metaphor for an unsupervised child? jesus gained his insight from the universe, rather than his parents.
- the word university comes from universe, the great teacher
