Human-AI pair programming workspace

- fast
- batteries included
- private, offline first, decentralized, open source
- extend existing communities when possible
- interoperate with existing paradigms when possible
- lower the barrier of entry for programmers
- use common sense
- reject analogies which have run their course - the file.

The target demographic is going to be the next generation of web and desktop application developers.
I want to lower the barrier of entry even more than the web already has, however I also want to do so
without compromising quality or performance in the next wave of software. The way I want to achieve that, is by building smarter, batteries included tooling.

The tool will enable humans of all skill levels to cooperate. Some people write natural language descriptions of the software. Other people/agents take those descriptions and turn them into more accurate descriptions. There is a fluid refinement. The descriptions are turned into code, which in turn is refined further. skilled developers can improve the performance, or restructure the code for better readability. engineers and scientists can write high performance compiler extensions in Rust.

At the bottom of the pyramid, you need to be able to extend the system by writing rust code directly.
