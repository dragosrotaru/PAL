If we decide on a particular REPL/runtime, then there is lock-in like with
JavaScript. If you take the WASM / EVM route, then you loose the semantic
connection between code. We can have the best of both worlds. You can use
a formal lamba calculus based language for computations on the graph, and
an impure language built for interactive computation and producing
interfaces.
