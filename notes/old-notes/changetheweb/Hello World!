From the beginning of knowable time, man has been on the search for meaning.
Why are we here? What does it all mean? In our search for meaning,
we have built new technologies to explore and share what we find -
Spoken Language. Oral Tradition. Cave Paintings. Petroglyphs.
Pictograms. Ideograms. The Alphabet. Written Language. The Gutenberg
Press. Journalism. Fire Signals. Telegraphs. Telephones. Radio.
Television. Computing. Programming. The Internet. Blockchain. Youtube.
Digital Memes. TikTok.
We are setting out to explore what the next paradigm might be.
Climb aboard partner, lets go on an adventure!

Some of the ideas you may see here are wacky. This initiative is all about
providing ourselves with the space to think creatively and out in the open.
To suspend disbelief, dream big and have a conversation about our future.
This site is a live journal of thoughts, research and discussions between friends.
We are intending to build a platform for non-linear conversation,
in which we will prototype and discuss the future of human information systems.
