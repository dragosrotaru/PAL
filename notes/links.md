The design of this interpreter was informed by [William Byrd on "The Most Beautiful Program Ever Written" [PWL NYC]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyfBQmvr2Hc), which is an incredible talk I recommend to anyone interested in Computer Science. This talk blew my mind - thanks William!

I also referred to [Mary Rose Cook's LittleLisp JS Interpreter](https://github.com/maryrosecook/littlelisp) to better understand the differences between a Meta Circular Evaluator as implemented in William's talk, and an Interpreter written in a different host language.
