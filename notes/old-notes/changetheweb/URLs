Say I wanted to borrow a book from my friend Jesse. The book I want is
George Orwell's "1984". I would ask for it by saying "Hey Jesse, can I
borrow your book, 1984?" If Jesse gave me "Brave New World"Â instead, I
would be able to look at the cover and realize that its not the book I
asked for. On the web, we use Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs for
short. We use URLs to identify pieces of information, like websites,
webpages or files. URLs dont work like book names. Instead, they work by
location. If we use the same analogy, its as if I were to ask "hey Jesse,
can you give me the book on your bedroom bookshelf, third shelf from the
ground, second book from the left." This is the first major flaw of the
web. Instead, we can make use of cryptographic Hashing (Content Adressable
Files, see IPFS) to reference pieces of information. Name are a bit more
tricky.
