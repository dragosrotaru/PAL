Change capitalization habits aquired from
DomainDrivenDesign/UbiquitousLanguage or keep them because they make it
clear that you are referring to a (Reified?Important?)Meaning? I feel like
capitals can be used like in German or TiddlyWiki to denote ProperNouns.
What are capitals? They sort of signal importance to the reader. Why do we
capitalize the beginning of a sentence? thats kinda weird, we should stop.
i think it makes more sense to capitalize a resolvable Names within
written language.
