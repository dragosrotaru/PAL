# Human-AI pair programming

- fully integrated, all batteries included, like smalltalk sqeak
- structural editor
- fuse file system - textual representation of source code is not the source of truth
- built with rust 
- dependent type system
- meta language

when AI is able to easily perform language-language translation, it doesnt really matter what language you write in. when AI is able to learn from code, does it make sense to have libraries/modules? ALL code is part of the standard library.

You can imagine a universal library of code, where each unit has tests, documentation and various implementations in various languages. each unit may even have variations. It would be cool if each one can get a universal ID. Or you could imagine that sharing code is completely unecessary. why would you need to import a 3rd party library when the cost of writing and maintaining everything from scratch is zero?
