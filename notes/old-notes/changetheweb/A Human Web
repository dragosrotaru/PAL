It is very clear that the way the web was built does not bode well with the way humans work.
Fake news, privacy, control, trust, misinformation, information warfare, information overload.
A breakdown of sense-making, loss of context in our communication and a polarization of society.
These are systemic issues that I posit we could substantially mitigate by starting from zero and
(re)creating a more human web; Something Tim Burners-Lee didnt have the time, knowledge or the
foresight to accomplish. \l brother-interview.json here \l is an interview I did with my
brother, who is 14 years old. I would like us to conduct more interviews with people of
all backgrounds to find what the future of the web should look like in the eyes of the common person.
