- Bring Back:
  - ZFC Axioms in your own words.
  - Russels / Cantors / Burali-Forti Paradoxes in your own words and Restricted vs Unrestricted Comprehension.
  - The implications of the Axiom of Choice (ZFC vs ZF).
  - Hereditary Sets vs urelements.
  - What are Proper Classes and Virtual Classes.
  - Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel Axioms in your own words.
  - What is the Von Neumann Universe aka Cumulative Hierarchy.
  - Morse–Kelley Axioms in your own words.
  - What does this mean: if ZFC is consistent, it is impossible to axiomatize ZFC using only finitely many axioms.
  - General Set Theory in your own words.
  - Peano Axioms in your own words.
  - Map out the subset relationships between the Set Theories.
  - What does this mean? ZFC cannot prove the existence of the inaccessible cardinals that category theory requires.
  - What does this mean? Abian & LaMacchia (1978) studied a subtheory of ZFC consisting of the axioms of extensionality, union, powerset, replacement, and choice. Using models, they proved this subtheory consistent, and proved that each of the axioms of extensionality, replacement, and power set is independent of the four remaining axioms of this subtheory. If this subtheory is augmented with the axiom of infinity, each of the axioms of union, choice, and infinity is independent of the five remaining axioms. Because there are non-well-founded models that satisfy each axiom of ZFC except the axiom of regularity, that axiom is independent of the other ZFC axioms.
