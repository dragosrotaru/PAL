A Node where

`d` is a finite sequence of arbitrary binary information
`l` is the byte length of `d` encoded in LEB128 or similar variable-length unsigned int binary encoding
`t` is a byte code representing the type `Node`
`h` is a multihash of `d`
`id` is the concatenatation of `t h l` into one sequence of binary information

An Edge where

`s` is a finite sequence of binary encoded multihashes
`l` is the byte length of `s` encoded in LEB128 or similar variable-length unsigned int binary encoding
`t` is a byte code representing the type `Edge`
`h` is a multihash of `s`
`id` is the concatenatation of `t h l` into one sequence of binary information
