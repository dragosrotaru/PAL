- Every `process` has exactly one `namespace`. A process named `bob_process` has a namespace named `bob_namespace`.
- Every `namespace` has a `root`. `bob_namespace` has root `bob_root`.
- `system_process` , `system_namespace` and `system_root` are special - there is exactly one of each for every `system`.
- Every other `namespace` exists within `system_namespace`, hence every `root` is a descendant of `system_root`.
- Any `process` can be a `parent_process`, creating a `child_process` which has a `child_namespace`, which must exist within `parent_namespace` and `child_root` as a child node of `parent_root`.  The child can run the same `program`, or a different `program` within `parent_namespace`.
- A `process` may also clone itself or execute another `program` from within its namespace in its place. cloning results in a child with identical program and linked or copied namespace as its parent.  cloning a process will also clone its children.
- executing results in a different program with the same namespace, while also terminating the parent.

- All processes have a `process_id` and children have a `parent_process_id`. These states are read-only.
- `processes` have `read` access to their entire `namespace` and `write` access to state they are the `owner` (or co-owner) of.
- `processes` share state in the following ways:
    - `copy source_name dest_name` - copying the state to the destination without maintaining any ownership over the destination state or name.
    - `bind source_name dest_name --read-only` - make the destination name point to the same data as the source_name, and allow child processes to read it only.
    - `bind source_name dest_name --read-and-write` make the destination name point to the same data as the source_name, and allow child processes to read and write to it.
    - `bind source_name dest_name --write-only` make the destination name point to the same data as the source_name, and allow child processes to write to it only.
    - `rename original_name new_name`  - rename some dataÂ within your namespace.
