We need to find a canonical form to store meaning in. Im reading about
Lambda Cube, Calculus of Constructions, Intuitionistic Type Theory. My
thinking is that while we cannot find a single formal system that is
complete and consistent (nor should we want to), we should be able to find
a single normal form encoding which is sufficient to encode the vast
majority meaning and provide interoperability, allowing humans and
automata to understand each other better at least for some finite time.
