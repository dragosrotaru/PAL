If I said "Do you know Donald?", what would you think I am referring to?
Is it someone you know personally? Someone well known, like Donald Trump
or Donald Duck? If we share a common connection and you are aware of this
fact then it would probably be that person. If we share a common context,
then it would be rational to think I am referring to the most referred to
entity in that context. In a human network name resolution can be imagined
to be some function of the social graph. In a generalized information
network, should it be any different? On the WWW we have a really broken
system for identifying and resolving things - URLs. When you use the web,
do you type in the url to the exact thing you are looking for or do you
search for it in the search bar? Why has the search bar been merged into
the address bar in most browsers? Why is such an important functionality
as search privatized and owned by Google/Microsoft/DuckDuckGo/etc? Why
does every single website implement its own search functionality?
According to the \l https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle Zooko's Conjecture \l,
We have to pick 2 out of 3 when building network protocols for name resolution: Human-meaningful, Secure and Decentalized.
There is a naming system called \l https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petname Petnames \l which is
believed to disprove this conjecture.
