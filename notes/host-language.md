Its tough to pick the right host language for this project. Here is why I picked Rust.

- its blazing fast ðŸ¦€
- other devs love Rust according to the surveys
- good sized community
- strong macro support, no homoiconicity but good enough 
- strong type system, no dependent types but good enough 
- bindings for machine learning libraries
- Rust is now in the Linux Kernel
- many important projects - wgpu, wasm, deno, servo, lapce, blockchain stuff
- lots of target environment options
- decent developer ergonomics, not like TypeScript but good enough.

Its an incredibly important decision with wide ranging implications. Choosing the wrong language
can lead to terrible experiences.
