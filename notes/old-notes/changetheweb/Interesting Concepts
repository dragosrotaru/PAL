The absence of something is hard to define. If an Edge is a Set, then the
empty edge is the Empty Set. What about the empty Node? If a Node is
absent of any information, is it `Nothing` ? `None`? `null`? `void`? Some
interesting concepts to think about:

Infinity
Truth (True and False Primitives)
Self
Time
Random
