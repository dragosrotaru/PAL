Complete Decentralization above Transport Layer. No Domain Name System,
No Certificate Authorities, No Search Engine Monopoly, No Social Graph
Monopoly, No Content Platform Monopoly. These Should all be in the
public domain.

Information Integrity. Content Addressable Information. A reference to a
source should be a pure function connecting to the substring within the
text. Computation Results should be verifiable through recomputation on
personal device. Information Archiving, Redundancy and Caching should be
built into the bones of the web and made easy for users and developers
alike.

Ownership, Sharing and Privacy. Expressive access control model for
information.

Interface Fluidity. Remove distinction between editing and browsing.
create a spectrum of control over UI. Allow information to be accessed
on the user's terms.

Some Backwards Compatibility. Integration Tools to work with the
existing WWW and outdated data formats like PDFs.


New Business Models. Advertising is nothing but propaganda. Make it easy
for content creators to build on the platform or publish content and get
paid via cryptocurrency.

Make the WWW a more safe and pleasant place.
Make it hard for pedophiles, trolls, scammers and hackers to abuse.

Man and Machine Symbiosis. Create a common protocol, semantic and
computational runtime for human and machine agents.
